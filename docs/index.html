        <div class="paragraph-wrapper2">
        <p>I have a B.S. in Computer Science, working towards a Master's degree currently, and have been into the arts since the 
            moment I could pick up a pencil, pen, crayon, or paintbrush. Then, graphic arts, the moment I got my first computer as kid. 
            This is not just a profession, it is a true passion and it is very rewarding to create things for others and see their happiness 
            and growth as an outcome.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-wrapper2">
        <p>You will not only receive a beautifully designed website or app, you'll also receive the best customer care, commitment, 
            and loyalty that is hard to find in this day and age. It is my goal to make you feel that trust and excitement from
            the beginning so that I can continue to work with you on all your current and future endeavors, as well as receive the 
            recognition and forward to your friends, colleagues, and network to build and grow my dream. </p>
